This report is the culmination of efforts, begun in November 2008, by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, to ascertain the key causes of the financial crisis. It identifies four causative factors: high-risk lending by US financial institutions, regulatory failures, inflated credit ratings and, high-risk, poor-quality financial products designed and sold by investment banks. It expands on the hearings conducted into these factors, as well as interviews and case studies, and provides findings of fact, analysis of the issues, and recommendations for next steps.

## Summary

The report comprises:
* An executive summary
* A chapter on the background to the events in question
